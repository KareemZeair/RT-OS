# Real-Time Operating Systems Course Repository

Welcome to the repository for my Real-Time Operating Systems course! This repository contains assignments, code samples, and resources related to the course.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Introduction to RTOS
- Description: This assignment introduces the basics of real-time operating systems and familiarizes students with the development environment. It involves writing a C program that performs system calls based on command-line arguments. The program supports various commands, including reading from a file, writing text to a file, and creating directories and subdirectories.
  
- Usage Instructions:
  - Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
  - Run the program from the command line with the following options:
    - `./syscalls read a-filename.txt` : Read from a file.
    - `./syscalls write something.txt "One line" "and another line"` : Write text to a file.
    - `./syscalls mkdir foo/bar` : Create directories and subdirectories.
    - `./syscalls help` : Get help on how to use the program.
